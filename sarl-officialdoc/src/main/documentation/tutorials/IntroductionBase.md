# SARL Basic

[:Outline:]

> **_Note:_** If you don't know how to solve an problem, or what is the function to be used, you could search on Internet for the answer using the API of the Java programming language. Indeed, since SARL is fully compatible with the Java API, you could use all the types or functions that are defined in this Java API.

## Exercise 1

Write a SARL program to print the following string in a specific format (see the output).

* Sample String: `Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are! Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are`
* Output:

```text
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
	How I wonder what you are! 
		Up above the world so high,   		
		Like a diamond in the sky. 
Twinkle, twinkle, little star, 
	How I wonder what you are
```

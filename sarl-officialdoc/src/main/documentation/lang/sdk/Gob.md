# Goal-oriented Behavior API

Goal-Oriented Behavior (GOB) is a general term that covers any technique taking into account goals of the agents.
GOB is not implemented by a single technique.
To cite few examples of GOB, you could find:

* Belief-Desire-Intension (BDI);
* Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP), which is a simplified version of STRIPS;
* [Time-based simple selection mechanism](./TGob.md) (TGOB).

All these approaches have the same base concepts: goals and actions.
The agents have goals to be realized; And, they select the best actions to reach these goals.
